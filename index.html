            <h1 id="abt">ABOUT DAHYUN</h1>
        <p>Dahyun was born in Seongnam, Gyeonggi, on May 28, 1998.
            She grew up with her parents and has an older brother.
            At a young age, she began singing with her Christian church choir.
            Dahyun first gained attention in sixth grade in elementary school 
            with a dance at church called the "eagle dance", which was posted on YouTube.
            Dahyun was recruited to become a trainee for JYP Entertainment after 
            a talent scout saw her performance at a dance festival, and she subsequently trained with them for over 
            three years. In 2015, Dahyun competed in Sixteen, a reality television show to determine the members of JYP 
            Entertainment's new girl group. One of the nine successful participants, Dahyun was subsequently selected 
            to join Twice as a singer and rapper. In October that year, she officially debuted with Twice with the 
            release of their extended play (EP), The Story Begins, and the lead single "Like Ooh-Ahh".
            Dahyun graduated from Hanlim Multi Art School in 2017.That year, in Gallup Korea's annual 
            music poll, she was voted the seventeenth most popular idol in South Korea.         
            In November 2018, Dahyun was criticized by right-wing Japanese lawmaker Masaru Onodera 
            for wearing a T-shirt made by Marymond, an organization that raises funds for helping comfort women, 
            victims of sexual slavery by the Imperial Japanese Army during World War II. In the aftermath, The Korea 
            Times criticized J. Y. Park, founder of JYP Entertainment, for failing to speak up in her defense.</p><br>
